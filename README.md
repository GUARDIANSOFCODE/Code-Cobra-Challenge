These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/CodeCobraChallenge.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/CodeCobraChallenge.git)
    cd CodeCobraChallenge
    ```
    (Replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username and adjust the repo name if different)

2.  **Compile the Java files:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt in the `CodeCobraChallenge` directory and run:
    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```

3.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    java SnakeGame
    ```

    The game window should now appear, ready for you to play!
